## Purpose

To enable NuGet integration in vim.

## Installation

Install using your favourite plugin manager,
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```viml
Plug 'markwoodhall/vim-nuget'
```

## Requirements

vim-nuget makes use of [vim-webapi](https://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim), [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim), and [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim).


```viml
Plug 'mattn/webapi-vim'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
Plug 'Shougo/deoplete.nvim'
```

## Configuration

If you have [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) installed and wish to use it for asynchronous package installations you can use the following setting:
```viml
let g:nuget_install_with_neomake = 1
```

## Commands

```viml
:SearchPackages query
```
